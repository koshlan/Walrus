### Full protocol for design of V1,V2 16S SSU rRNA amplicon primers

#### Dual-Index Primers

The dual-index approach apllied on Illumina MiSeq instrument is well described by a paper: Kozich et al. (2013) in the lab of Patrick Schloss (University of Michigan): (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23793624). A full protocol is availabe: (http://www.mothur.org/w/images/0/0c/Wet-lab_MiSeq_SOP.pdf). The protocol describes step that can be taken to extend the approach to other regions of the 16S rRNA gene using alternative amplification primer sequences. A paper by Macintyre et al. (2015) adapt the commonly used 27F and 388R primres used for amplification of the 16S primers targeting the V1, V2 hypervariable regions. (http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150311/srep08988/full/srep08988.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=tumblr#methods); however the paper does not list the primers used and the corresponding author was on a extended leave in July-August 2015.

The method section from Macintyre et al: (2015) does provided the following

Notably the authors do not describe the anticomplimentary linker region described in the Kozich protocol.
